        <p>
          You are invited to the first installment of p2p berlin, a regular
          get-together for everyone drawn to distributed and decentralised
          technology and a new Internet outside of corporate control.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are on the web today, you depend on cloud infrastructure driven
          and controlled by people you don't know. Peer-to-peer can be a
          wonderful technology to break out of this stronghold by creating your
          own infrastructure. In the past two years there has been a resurgence
          of this tech in projects like the Dat-Protocol, IPFS and Secure
          Scuttlebutt, building everything from low-level libraries to full-on
          decentralised replacements of social media platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please come join us for this informal gathering to learn about recent
          developments in the field, show and tell about our own p2p projects
          and to find out how you can make use of and contribute to these
          projects yourself.
