          This is a get-together for everyone interested in the new Internet
          outside of corporate control that is now being built using
          decentralised technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          In our meetings we update each other about everything interesting that
          has been happening recently in the field, discuss current developments
          and offer a platform to showcase your cool p2p project or idea.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are not interested in blockchain projects that hijack a buzzword to
          fulfill neoliberal fantasies. We are especially interested in p2p tech
          as a path for people to do cool stuff together without centralised
          control.
        </p>
        <p>Please join our next event and RSVP below.</p>

              Join us in January to continue the conversation about how we can
              find and organize events using p2p software. There will also be a
              newsflash with updates from the p2p-world.

                interviewing people and documenting their approaches to collect
                knowledge about how to solve ux problems in distributed systems.

                Lukas is presenting a project started within the Reclaim Club
                Culture group with the aim of getting clubs to promote their
                events on distributed platforms instead of posting them on
                Facebook. See their
